Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

 A:It allows you to quickly and easily see both files which allows you to spot differences quickly. If you had to look in one file and then open the other you could forget what you had in the first file and it could lead to even more mistakes. 

 What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

 Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
